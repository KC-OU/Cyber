### The Box offers two certifications:

- **HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS):** This certification is designed for penetration testers with intermediate-level skills. It assesses your ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a variety of systems and applications.
- **HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (CBBH):** This certification is designed for bug bounty hunters with intermediate-level skills. It assesses your ability to find and report security vulnerabilities in web applications and other software.

To take either certification exam, you must first complete the corresponding job-role path in the Hack The Box Academy. The job-role paths are a series of modules that teach you the skills and knowledge you need to pass the exam.

The exams are both hands-on and require you to complete a penetration test or bug bounty hunt. You will be given a limited amount of time to complete the exam, and your work will be graded by a panel of experts.

If you pass the exam, you will receive a certificate that is recognized by employers and other organizations.
