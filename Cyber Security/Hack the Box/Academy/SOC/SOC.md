# Hack the Box SOC 


A SOC analyst, also known as a security operations centre analyst, is a cybersecurity professional who is responsible for monitoring and analysing security alerts and events to identify and respond to cyber threats. SOC analysts work in a 24/7 environment to protect their organization's systems, networks, and data from cyberattacks.

SOC analysts use a variety of tools and techniques to monitor and analyse security data, including:

- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- Firewalls
- Log management systems
- Network traffic analysis tools

SOC analysts also use their knowledge of cybersecurity threats and trends to identify suspicious activity and to investigate potential incidents. When a SOC analyst detects a potential threat, they will investigate the threat to determine its severity and to recommend a response. The response may involve escalating the incident to a more experienced analyst or security professional, implementing mitigation measures, or taking steps to eradicate the threat.

SOC analysts play a vital role in protecting organizations from cyberattacks. They are responsible for detecting, investigating, and responding to cyber threats 24/7. SOC analysts must have a strong understanding of cybersecurity threats and trends, as well as the ability to use security tools and techniques effectively.
