Hack The Box Battlegrounds is a real-time multiplayer hacking game where two teams of 1, 2, or 4 players each battle for supremacy over the environment. It is the first truly multiplayer experience brought to you by Hack The Box.

To play, each player needs a virtual machine with Parrot Security OS deployed on it, from where they will download their Battlegrounds OpenVPN pack. The game is played over a VPN, so players can't directly interact with each other's machines.

The game is divided into two phases: the attack phase and the defense phase. In the attack phase, players try to hack into the opponent's machines and capture their flags. In the defense phase, players try to protect their own machines from being hacked.

The game is won by the team that captures the most flags or has the most machines at the end of the match.

Hack The Box Battlegrounds is a great way to learn about offensive and defensive hacking techniques. It is also a lot of fun and can be quite competitive.

#### Here are some of the features of Hack The Box Battlegrounds:

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Two game modes: attack and defense
- A variety of hacking techniques to learn
- A competitive and challenging environment
