Hack The Box (HTB) is an online platform that offers virtual machines (VMs) that are intentionally vulnerable to attack. These VMs are designed to help users learn penetration testing and ethical hacking skills.

HTB machines are rated on a difficulty scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult. There are currently over 370 machines available, covering a wide range of operating systems and vulnerabilities.

To use HTB machines, users need to create an account and then connect to the VPN service provided by HTB. Once connected, users can select a machine to attack. 

Each machine has a set of challenges that the user must complete in order to gain root access. These challenges can involve tasks such as finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining access to user accounts, and escalating privileges.

HTB machines are a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn penetration testing or ethical hacking. They provide a safe and realistic environment in which users can practice their skills.

#### Here are some of the benefits of using HTB machines:

- They are realistic and challenging. The machines are intentionally vulnerable, so users can learn how to exploit real-world security vulnerabilities.
- They are versatile. There are machines available for a wide range of operating systems and vulnerabilities.
- They are community-driven. The machines are created and maintained by a community of security professionals, so they are constantly being updated with new challenges.
- They are affordable. HTB offers a free tier that gives users access to a limited number of machines.
