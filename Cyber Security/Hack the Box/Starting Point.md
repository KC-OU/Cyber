# Starting Point

Starting on **Hack The Box** can be a bit daunting. There's a lot to learn, and it can be overwhelming for someone who is new to our platform. Figuring out how to connect to the VPN, spawn a **Box**, enumerate it, and then actually hack it? It's a lot. That's why we've introduced our revamped **Starting Point**.

**Starting Point** is **Hack The Box** on rails. It's a linear series of **Boxes** tailored to absolute beginners and features very easy exploit paths to not only introduce you to our platform but also break the ice into the realm of penetration testing. Using the **Starting Point**, you can get a feel for how **Hack The Box** works, how to connect and interact with **Boxes**, and pave a basic foundation for your hacking skills to build off of.

Each **Starting Point Box** comes with a comprehensive **writeup** that explains not only how to solve the **Box**, but each of the concepts involved at every step.

We highly recommend you supplement **Starting Point** with **HTB Academy**. Whereas **Starting Point** serves as a guided introduction to the **Hack The Box Main Platform**, **HTB Academy** is a learning platform that guides you through developing the pentesting skills you'll need to succeed not only on **Hack The Box**, but in the field of ethical hacking as a whole.
