These are just a few of the many series available on TryHackMe. There is something for everyone, regardless of your experience level.

If you are new to cyber security, I recommend starting with the Foundations series. This will give you a good understanding of the basics. Once you have a solid foundation, you can move on to more advanced series.

You can also find a list of all the series available on the TryHackMe website.

#### Here are some additional tips for choosing a TryHackMe series:

- Consider your experience level. If you are new to cyber security, choose a series that is designed for beginners.
- Choose a series that interests you. If you are not interested in the topic, you are less likely to stick with it.
- Look for a series that has good reviews. This will give you an idea of whether the series is well-written and informative.
